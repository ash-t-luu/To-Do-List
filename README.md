# to-do-list

Built a to-do list web application using vanilla DOM Manipulation and CSS. 
Implemented Google OAuth using OAuth 2.0 with PostgreSQL database and Node.js with Express server backend.

Was fun to deepen my understanding of DOM Manipulation with CRUD API to support my knowledge of abstraction in native React and client-browser relationship.
